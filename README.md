Mirror Corp
===========

Mirror Corp is a backend prototype for the mobile social networking app Corpus, which was initially inspired by a similar app named Circum.

With Mirror Corp, we'll be able to save the data sent from the Corpus client to our server and prepare for the procedure of protocol analyzation, which makes the API specification clear later.

## Getting Started

Make sure the directory is writable, which is required for Mirror Corp to save received data.

## Usage

Just send any POST data to index.php, and your request will be recorded.
